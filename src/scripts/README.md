# Scripts | Pokemon Masters DB - Game Database

In this section there are some scripts that I wrote to copy the data from pokemonmasters.gamepress.gg.
I made this because I'm no masochist, when I faced the fact that everthing must be copied by hand, line by line I tryed to avoid that before suicide.

Feel free to use the scripts with the same purpose or modify them to your will.

## How to use the scripts?

Go to the folder of interest (it must be empty), ex: pokemon

1. `cd gamedatabase/src/pokemon`
2. `node ../scripts/getPokemonData.js`
3. Enjoy all the pokemon json files
